## Motivation

We developed this game to further expand our understanding of React. While developing the game we learned about:

1. Randomizing an array of information.
2. Comparing two items at a time and comparing them.
3. Game design.
4. App wireframing and where specific states should live.
5. Rendering a user's score and ranking when it fell outside of the top 10 highest scores.
6. Displaying and manipulating a timer.
