# Total Recall

## What is Total Recall?

Total Recall is an arcade style memory game. Users can compete to have their score in top ten.

## Motivation

We developed this game to further expand our understanding of React. While developing the game we learned about:

1. Randomizing an array of information.
2. Comparing two items at a time and comparing them.
3. Game design.
4. App wireframing and where specific states should live.
5. Rendering a user's score and ranking when it fell outside of the top 10 highest scores.
6. Displaying and manipulating a timer.

## Backend
Total Recall's backend is built using a Ruby on Rails API, with endpoints for the users and scores.

It is hosted on [heroku](http://total-recall-backend.herokuapp.com/).
